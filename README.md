# Lab-Manual-4
Dear Sir
During the task the lab pc was not working properly and I was facing numerous issues:
1) Very slow to type
2) Snipping tool and screenshot was not working
3) copy paste was not working rather code would shuffle when I tried to select it for copy paste

 Due to these reasons I wasnt able to show screenshot of output or properly copy code with indentations.
 I therefore emailed myself the cpp file , went home and used the same code to make a proper word file
 I would kindly request you to consider the updated new lab task 4 even though it was submitted after the 5pm deadline due to the genuine issues that I faces during the task.
